  s.description  = <<-DESC
					URLSession framework is, on its own, incompatible with Operation API. A bit of trickery is required to make them cooperate.
					I have extended URLSessionTask with additional properties of specific closure types which allows you to overcome this incompatibility. 

					OperationQueue and Operation are great API to use when...

					* your network requests are inter-dependent on each other
					* need to implement OAuth2 or any other kind of asynchronous 3rd-party authentication mechanism
					* tight control over the number of concurrent requests towards a particular host is paramount
					* etc.
